How does it work?

- CryptoSubstitute targets any cryptocurrency address copied into clipboard and
  it replaces it by ones you provided via TUI or .csv file

Why make it? When crypto currencies got popular our world changed forever,
because of it's popularity, anonymous but open nature and money it grants - more
and more targets get attacked. Our goal is to provide such attacking tool for
educational purposes.

If used on Linux machine - xclip or xsel has to be installed.
